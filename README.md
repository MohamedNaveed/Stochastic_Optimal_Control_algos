# Stochastic_Optimal_Control_algos

The repository includes the implementation of the following algorithms:
1) Model Predictive Control (MPC)
2) Trajectory Optimised Linear Quadratic regulator (T-LQR)
3) Trajectory Optimised Linear Quadratic regulator with replanning (T-LQR2).

It also includes some of their variants namely MPC-SH, T-LQR2-SH where the control horizon can be changed as per requirements. The algorithms are written for a general case of n agents, and the agents follow car-like robot dynamics.

Package requirements:
i) CasAdi - NLP solver.
